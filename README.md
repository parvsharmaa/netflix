# Netflix

This is a fully responsive full-stack Netflix application built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **NestJS** for the backend. The app mimics Netflix's core features like user authentication, movie listings, favorites, and more.

## Features

### Frontend
- **Home Page**:
  - Displays a list of movies and series.
  - Each movie card shows a blurred effect on hover with visible movie info and action buttons.
- **Authentication**:
  - **Login/Signup Page** located at `/auth`. 
  - User registration and login with backend auth services
- **Favorites**:
  - Authenticated users can add movies to their favorites.
  - A **My List** page shows all the user's favorite movies with a minus icon to remove from the list.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Includes a mobile menu with navigation links to Home, Series, Movies, New & Popular, and My List.
  - Responsive footer with a link to the developer's GitHub.
  
### Backend
- **Authentication**:
  - Built with NestJS, allowing users to register and login.
  - Passwords are hashed for security.
  - JSON Web Token (JWT) used for authorization and stored in localStorage on successful login.
- **MongoDB Integration**:
  - MongoDB Atlas is used as the database for managing users and their favorite movies.
  - The Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) library is used for defining schemas and interacting with MongoDB.
  
### Third-Party API
- **OMDb API**:
  - Fetches movie and series data based on user input or hardcoded requests.
